                <p> Hello! I'm Anna, an aspiring full stack developer. I'm passionate about projects that intertwine  ecology, sustainability and culture â€“ realms where technology can contribute positive change. With a humanistic approach to technology, I'm drawn to UX-design. I believe that true elegance lies in simplicity.

                 <p>
                    My artistic background(Gerrit Rietveld Academie, 2017) has enriched my perspective on creativity and problem-solving. Now, I'm eager to blend these sensibilities and skills with technology to create innovative and impactful solutions. If your project carries a cultural narrative or is dedicated to sustainability, count me in.
